WP-Plugin-Makefile
==================

A Makefile for pushing changes easily from a git repo to a WordPress plugin repo

## Special Notes ##

Currently everything is tested and confirmed working **EXCEPT** the act of actually committing changes to the WordPress Plugin Repo.
I hope to do this very shortly.

There is documentation in the Makefile, but I will be adding some more explanations in the near future.
